I help run campaigns for climate justice at <a href=https://amazonwatch.org/>Amazon Watch</a>. I completed a master’s degree in Environmental Justice at the University of Michigan’s School for Environment and Sustainability, where I researched the environmental justice implications of electric vehicles. I used to be a software engineer. Some things I am thinking about: <b>political ecology, energy justice, transportation, degrowth</b>
